# .emacs.d

Package management is based on [Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude)

This configuration closely resembles that of [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/).
I chose not to use Spacemacs, instead chose to configure my own as it helps me
to learn elisp and also to know what's happening behind the scenes
